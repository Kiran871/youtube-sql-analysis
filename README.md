# 📊 YouTube India Trending Video SQL Analysis

This project explores YouTube India’s trending video dataset using SQL (SQLite). It covers viewer behavior, channel performance, engagement rates, and trend timelines. The analysis uses real-world data from Kaggle and is structured to demonstrate SQL proficiency for portfolio or resume use.

## Project Files

- `youtube_india_clean.csv` – Cleaned dataset (manually preprocessed and formatted for SQLite)
- `SQLite.sql` – SQL query file containing common and complex analytical queries
- `README.md` – Project overview, questions answered, tools used, and insights

## Key Questions Answered

- What are the top 10 most viewed and liked trending videos?
- Which channels have the highest total and average views?
- How many days do videos typically take to trend after publishing?
- What is the engagement ratio (likes/dislikes/comments to views)?
- Which categories or channels dominate trending?
- Are there any unusual outliers (like more likes than views)?

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [SQLiteOnline.com](https://sqliteonline.com) – Web-based SQLite interface
- SQLite syntax and functions (CTEs, window functions, aggregates, subqueries)
- GitHub – Project version control and publishing

## How to Run This Project

1. Go to [SQLiteOnline.com](https://sqliteonline.com)
2. Upload `youtube_india_clean.csv` as a new table: `youtube_india_clean`
3. Open `SQLite.sql` and paste the queries into the SQL editor
4. Run each query block to see insights

## Highlights & Insights

- Some videos trend for over 10 days across multiple dates
- Channels like T-Series have a high number of trending videos
- Like-to-dislike ratios vary significantly across categories
- Engagement rate doesn’t always correlate with total views
